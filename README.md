# Today?
  A straight forward webapp written in Python and Flask which can be used to check events happened on this day using Wikipedia's On This Day API.\
  I've also used [TailBocks](https://tailblocks.cc/) copy-pasta service to spare me the pain of writing html pages from scratch.\
  ~~Currently, the navigation panel isn't responsive which will be fixed later.~~ As a quick fix, removed meta viewport from `base.html` to display desktop mode by default.
